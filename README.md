# Accelerometer data pipeline (fitbit ionic device)
 
 * These codes form a pipeline that collects tri-axial accelerometer data using a fitbit ionic device.
 
 * (from ionic device to mysql database)
 
 
* Basically, the subjects who wear the device were assumed to wear it outside the hospital, 


and the visited hospital was constructed to transmit data to the mysql database of the hospital server through the companion.
 
 
* However, this app is considered a limitation because it only lasts 5 days when running the app.

* This code is open source, and other comments and questions are open at any time.
